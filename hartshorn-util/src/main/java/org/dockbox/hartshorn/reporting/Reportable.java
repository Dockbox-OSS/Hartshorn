 * A type that can be reported on. This is used to provide diagnostics information about a type.

 * <p>Implementations are expected to provide information about the type itself, as well as any
 * information about the type's dependencies. Note that the information provided by this interface
 * is not expected to be exhaustive, but rather to provide a high-level overview of the type.
 *
 * <p>It is not required that implementations of this interface be thread-safe, nor is it required
 * that they be immutable. However, implementations are expected to be side-effect free.
