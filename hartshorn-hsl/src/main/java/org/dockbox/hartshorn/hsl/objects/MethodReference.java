/**
 * Represents a reference to a method. This could represent e.g. a method defined in a script, or a
 * method loaded from a Java class file. Exact semantics are defined by the implementation.
 *
 * <p>Method references are {@link CallableNode}s, and can be called with a bound instance, or by
 * providing an instance as an argument. Both are equivalent to calling the method on the
 * instance. Implementations may choose to provide a default instance, or require an instance to be
 * provided. If an implementation provides a default instance, it may choose to ignore the given
 * instance when calling the method.
 *
 * <p>Method references are {@link BindableNode}s, and can be bound to an instance. This allows quick
 * access to the method, without having to provide the instance as an argument.
