/**
 * A module that can be used to extend the HSL language. This module is responsible for combining the required definitions
 * for a specific type of AST node, including a parser, interpreter, and resolver. The module is also responsible for
 * defining the token type that the parser should use to identify the node.
 *
 * <p>Extensions are not automatically enabled, and must be registered through a {@link RuntimeExtensionCodeCustomizer} in
 * order for them to become available.
 *
 * <p>Custom AST nodes are used to extend the HSL language with custom syntax. This can be used to add new expressions,
 * statements, or even entire new languages. All custom nodes must implement the {@link CustomASTNode} interface, which
 * ensures that the node is associated with a module that defines the required definitions for the node.
 *
 * <p>Custom nodes can be used in the same way as any other node, and can be used in any context where the node type is
 * accepted. This includes expressions and statements. Note that custom nodes are not automatically resolved, if this is
 * required the {@link ASTExtensionModule#resolver()} method must be overridden to provide a resolver.
 *
 * <p>To ensure that custom nodes are correctly interpreted, implementations are limited to valid
 * {@link org.dockbox.hartshorn.hsl.ast.expression.Expression expressions} and {@link org.dockbox.hartshorn.hsl.ast.statement.Statement statements}.
 * You can use the {@link ExpressionModule} and {@link StatementModule} interfaces to ensure that the correct type of
 * node is returned by the parser.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of AST node that this module is responsible for.
 * @param <R> The return type of the interpreter for this module.
