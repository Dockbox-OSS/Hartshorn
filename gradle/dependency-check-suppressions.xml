    Risk accepted: CVE-2022-42920

    Dependency check fails due to a transitive dependency on Apache BCEL with CVE-2022-42920.
    This is present through annotation-tools-3.27.0 which in turn is present through Checker Framework 3.27.0 (shaded).
    While we keep the CF annotations through org.checkerframework:checker-qual:3.27.0, we do not use the implementation
    of CF3.27.0 at runtime, as we only use it for compile-time constraint validation (nullable validation).
