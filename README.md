[Hartshorn](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/) is a cutting-edge Java framework built on the JVM platform that offers comprehensive support for modular, scalable, and testable application development using Java and other JVM-based languages. Its main objective is to simplify the creation and administration of intricate JVM applications by providing developers with the necessary tools. To learn more about Hartshorn's fundamental technologies and principles, you can refer to the dedicated topic on [core technologies](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/core/cdi/).

## Getting started

If you are new to Hartshorn, the official documentation website has a [Getting Started](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/getting-started/setup/) section that provides comprehensive guides to help you get started quickly. The guides use Hartshorn's application starter to facilitate your initial setup. Additionally, if you only need the Maven dependencies for your project, they are listed below for your convenience.

### Maven configuration

The framework provides the flexibility to selectively utilize the required modules by including their dedicated dependencies. You can access all the modules and their corresponding releases on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.dev/namespace/org.dockbox.hartshorn).

To begin, add the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.dockbox.hartshorn</groupId>
  <artifactId>hartshorn-launchpad</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, use this implementation:

```groovy
implementation "org.dockbox.hartshorn:hartshorn-launchpad:$version"
```

### Starting your first application

The process of starting with Hartshorn is straightforward, and the example below will help you understand the basic steps of setting up and executing your first application.

The `HartshornApplication` class is used to build Hartshorn applications. It serves as the entry point of your application and performs the bootstrapping process. The process initiates a self-contained `ApplicationContext` that manages your application's lifecycle.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = HartshornApplication.create();
    // ...
}
```

`ApplicationContext` is at the heart of Hartshorn, and its primary responsibility is to manage your application's lifecycle. It also manages your application's dependency injection container, which enables the injection of dependencies. The `@Binds` annotation is used to declare dependencies, which binds a type to its implementation. To inject dependencies, you can use the @Inject annotation.

```java
@Binds
public String helloWorld() {
    return "Hello World!";
}
```

Managed components are part of your application structure, meaning they are automatically discovered and registered. Components annotated with `@Component` or a stereotype annotation annotated with `@Component`, such as `@Service`, are considered managed.

```java
@Service
public class SampleService {
    
    @Inject
    private String helloWorld;
    
    public void sayHelloWorld() {
        System.out.println(helloWorld);
    }
}
```

Finally, we can bring everything together and print "Hello World!" to the console using our `SampleService`.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = HartshornApplication.create();
    SampleService sampleService = applicationContext.get(SampleService.class);
    sampleService.sayHelloWorld();
}
```

### Next steps

Once you've taken your first steps with Hartshorn, it's essential to expand your knowledge of the framework. The [documentation](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/) is an excellent starting point that will help you become more familiar with the framework. Additionally, you can explore the [examples repository](https://github.com/Dockbox-OSS/Hartshorn-Examples) for more comprehensive examples.

## Building Hartshorn

If you want to build Hartshorn yourself, either to access pre-release versions or to customize the framework, the guide below explains how to build usable JAR artifacts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that you will need a Java installation with JDK 21 or a more recent version for all platforms.

Hartshorn uses Maven to automate builds, performing several steps before and after a build has completed. To build all Hartshorn modules at once, run `mvn clean install` in the base directory. This will build all modules and run all tests. If you want to skip tests, you can use the `-DskipTests` flag.
