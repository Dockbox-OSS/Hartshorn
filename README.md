<hr>

[Hartshorn](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/) is a modern framework built on the JVM platform that
offers support for modular, scalable, and testable application development using Java and other
JVM-based languages. Its main objective is to simplify the creation and administration of complex
JVM applications by providing developers with an easy to use ecosystem of utilities and conventions.
To learn more about Hartshorn's fundamental technologies and principles, you can refer to the
dedicated topic on [core technologies](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/core/cdi/).

## Getting started

If you are new to Hartshorn, the official documentation website has
a [getting started](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/getting-started/setup/) section that provides
comprehensive guides to help you get started quickly. The guides use Hartshorn's application starter
to facilitate your initial setup. Additionally, if you only need the Maven dependencies for your
project, they are listed below for your convenience.

### Maven configuration

The framework provides the flexibility to selectively utilize the required modules by including
their dedicated dependencies. You can access all the modules and their corresponding releases
on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.dev/namespace/org.dockbox.hartshorn).

To begin, add the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.dockbox.hartshorn</groupId>
  <artifactId>hartshorn-launchpad</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, use this implementation:

```groovy
implementation "org.dockbox.hartshorn:hartshorn-launchpad:$version"
```

### Starting your first application

The process of starting with Hartshorn is straightforward, and the example below will help you
understand the basic steps of setting up and executing your first application.

The `HartshornApplication` class is used to build Hartshorn applications. It serves as the entry
point of your application and performs the bootstrapping process. The process initiates a
self-contained `ApplicationContext` that manages your application's lifecycle.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Derives the main class automatically ..
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = HartshornApplication.create(args);

    // .. alternatively you can pass your main class as an argument
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = HartshornApplication.create(MyMainClass.class, args);

    // .. or you can configure almost every aspect of the application
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = HartshornApplication.createApplication(MyMainClass.class, args).initialize(configurer -> {
        // See HartshornApplicationConfigurer for more options
    });
}
```

`ApplicationContext` is at the heart of Hartshorn, and its primary responsibility is to manage your
application's lifecycle. It also manages your application's dependency injection container, which
enables the injection of dependencies.

### Dependency injection

The `@Binds` annotation is used to declare dependencies, which binds a type to its implementation.
However, typically you should not use it directly. Instead, you can use the provided `@Singleton`
and `@Prototype` annotations to declare your components. `@Singleton` components are created once
and shared across the application, while `@Prototype` components are created each time they are
requested.

```java
@Configuration
public class HelloWorldConfiguration {

    @Singleton // Shared across the application
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
    
    @Prototype // Created each time it is requested
    public OtherComponent otherComponent() {
        return new OtherComponent();
    }
}
```

Managed components are part of your application structure, meaning they are automatically discovered
and registered. Components annotated with `@Component` or a stereotype annotation annotated with
`@Component`, such as `@Configuration`, are considered managed.

```java
@Component
public class HelloWorldComponent {
    
    @Inject
    private String helloWorld;
    
    public void sayHelloWorld() {
        System.out.println(helloWorld);
    }
}
```

Finally, we can bring everything together and print "Hello World!" to the console using our
`SampleService`.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = HartshornApplication.create();
    HelloWorldComponent helloWorldComponent = applicationContext.get(HelloWorldComponent.class);
    helloWorldComponent.sayHelloWorld();
}
```

### Next steps

Once you've taken your first steps with Hartshorn, it's essential to expand your knowledge of the
framework. The [documentation](https://hartshorn.dockbox.org/) is an excellent starting point that
will help you become more familiar with the framework. Additionally, you can explore
the [Launchpad sample applications](./hartshorn-launchpad-samples) for more comprehensive examples.

## Building Hartshorn

If you want to build Hartshorn yourself, either to access pre-release versions or to customize the
framework, the guide below explains how to build usable JAR artifacts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that you will need a Java installation with JDK 21 or a more recent version for all
> platforms.

Hartshorn uses Maven to automate builds, performing several steps before and after a build has
completed. To build all Hartshorn modules at once, run `mvn clean install` in the base directory.
This will build all modules and run all tests. If you want to skip tests, you can use the
`-DskipTests` flag.
