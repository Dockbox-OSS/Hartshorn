DarwinCore (API) 3.1
====================

A WIP branch to restructure DarwinCore (previously DarwinServer) to a cleaner architecture.
DarwinCore 3.0 will primarily use Kotlin for utilities, with stricter stylechecks than present in earlier versions.
DC3.0 currently targets Minecraft 1.12.2 and Sponge 7.x. Paper/Bukkit implementations are not yet supported.
