A WIP branch to restructure DarwinCore/DarwinServer to a cleaner architecture under a new name.
Selene will primarily use Kotlin for utilities, with stricter stylechecks than present in earlier versions.
Selene currently targets Minecraft 1.12.2 and Sponge 7.x. Paper/Bukkit implementations are not yet supported.
