/**
 * The entrypoint for creating proxy objects. This class is responsible for creating proxy objects for
 * a given class, and is a default contract provided in all {@code ComponentProcessingContext}s for
 * components that permit the creation of proxies.
 *
 * <p>Proxy factories are responsible for creating proxy objects for a given class, after the proxy
 * has been created, the proxy object is passed to the responsible {@link ProxyManager} for further
 * life-cycle management. Proxy factories are able to create zero or more unique proxy objects for
 * a given class, and are responsible for ensuring that the proxy objects are unique.
 *
 * <p>To support the creation of proxies, the {@link ProxyFactory} exposes a set of methods that
 * can be used to modify the proxy object before it is created. This includes the delegation and
 * interception of methods.
 *
 * <h1>Interception</h1>
 * <p>Interception indicates the method is replaced by whichever implementation is chosen. Interception
 * can be done in two ways; full replacement, and wrapping.
 *
 * <h2>Full replacement interception</h2>
 * <p>A full replacement is done using a custom
 * {@link MethodInterceptor}, which accepts a {@link MethodInterceptorContext} to execute given functionality.
 * Within an interceptor it is possible to access all required information about the intercepted method,
 * as can be seen in the {@link MethodInterceptorContext} class.
 *
 * <p>Method interceptors are executed in series, allowing each step to re-use and/or modify the result of
 * another interceptor. To do so, the previous {@link MethodInterceptorContext#result()} is provided. If
 * the interceptor is the first one to execute, the result will be the default value of the return type.
 * The series are executed in no specific order.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * factory.intercept(greetingMethod, interceptorContext -> "Hello world!");
 * final User user = factory.proxy().get();
 * final String greeting = user.greeting(); // Returns 'Hello world!'
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Wrapping interception</h2>
 * <p>Wrapping interception is similar to the pre-existing method phasing
 * approach. It allows for specific callbacks to be executed before a method is performed, after it is finished,
 * and when an exception is thrown during the execution of the method. Wrappers will always be executed, even
 * if the method is intercepted or delegated. This allows for specific states to be prepared and closed around
 * a method's execution. For example, an annotation like {@code @Transactional} the wrapper can be used to:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Open a transaction before the method is performed</li>
 *     <li>Commit the transaction after the method is finished</li>
 *     <li>Rollback the transaction if an exception is thrown</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class UserMethodExecutionLogger implements MethodWrapper<User> {
 *     @Override
 *     public void acceptBefore(final MethodView<?, User> method, final User instance, final Object[] args) {
 *         System.out.println("Before method!");
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void acceptAfter(final MethodView<?, User> method, final User instance, final Object[] args) {
 *         System.out.println("After method!");
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void acceptError(final MethodView<?, User> method, final User instance, final Object[] args, final Throwable error) {
 *         System.out.println("Method caused an exception: " + error.getMessage());
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <pre>{@code
 * factory.intercept(greetingMethod, new UserMethodExecutionLogger());
 * final User user = factory.proxy().get();
 * user.speakGreeting();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The above would then result in the following output:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Before method!
 * User says: Hello world!
 * After method!
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h1>Delegation</h1>
 * <p>Like interception, delegation replaces the implementation of a proxy object. However, it does not carry the proxy's
 * context down to the implementation. Instead, it redirects the method call to another object. Delegation knows two different
 * delegate types; original instance, and backing implementations.
 *
 * <h2>Original instance delegation</h2>
 * <p>Original instance delegation indicates that the delegate is of the exact same type as the proxy type, or a sub-type of that
 * type. This allows all functionality to be delegated to this instance.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface User {
 *     String greeting();
 * }
 * public class UserImpl implements User {
 *     @Override
 *     public String greeting() {
 *         return "Hello implementation!";
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <pre>{@code
 * final StateAwareProxyFactory<User, ?> factory = applicationManager.factory(User.class);
 * factory.delegate(new UserImpl());
 * final User user = factory.proxy().get();
 * user.greeting(); // Returns 'Hello implementation!'
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Backing implementation delegation</h2>
 * <p>Backing implementations follow the opposite rule of original instance delegation. Instead of requiring the exact type or a subtype to
 * be implemented, backing implementations delegate the behavior of a given parent of the type. This allows types like {@code JpaRepository}
 * implementations to specifically delegate to e.g. {@code HibernateJpaRepository}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface User extends ContextCarrier {
 *     String greeting();
 * }
 * public class ContextCarrierImpl implements ContextCarrier {
 *     @Override
 *     public ApplicationContext applicationContext() {
 *         return ...;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <pre>{@code
 * final StateAwareProxyFactory<User, ?> factory = applicationManager.factory(User.class);
 * factory.delegate(ContextCarrier.class, new ContextCarrierImpl());
 * final User user = factory.proxy().get();
 * user.applicationContext(); // Returns a valid application context
 * user.greeting(); // Yields an exception as no implementation is assigned and the method is abstract
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>However, it is not unlikely a delegate returns itself in chained method calls. To avoid leaking the delegate, method handles always check if
 * the returned object is the delegate, and will replace it with the proxy instance if it is so.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface Returner {
 *     Returner self();
 * }
 * public interface User extends Returner {
 *     String greeting();
 * }
 * public class ReturnerImpl implements Returner {
 *     @Override
 *     public Returner self() {
 *         return this;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <pre>{@code
 * final StateAwareProxyFactory<User, ?> factory = applicationManager.factory(User.class);
 * factory.delegate(Returner.class, new ReturnerImpl());
 * final User user = factory.proxy().get();
 * user.self(); // Returns the user proxy object instead of the ReturnerImpl instance
 * }</pre>
