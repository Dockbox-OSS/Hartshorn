 * Represents a property within the application's configuration, typically exposed through

 * {@link ValueProperty value properties}, {@link ListProperty list properties} and
 * {@link ObjectProperty object properties}. Each of these types of properties can be used to
 * represent different types of configuration values. As each form of property exposes data in a
 * different way, there is no value in using this interface directly. Instead, use one of the three
 * sub-interfaces.
