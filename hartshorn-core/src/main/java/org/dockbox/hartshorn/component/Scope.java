/**
 * {@link Scope Scopes} can be used to represent a specific scope in which
 * components are registered. Scopes are used to determine which components are
 * available in which context.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface do not need to be thread-safe, as they
 * are not directly responsible for managing the hierarchies of components.
 * Instead, these hierarchies are managed by a {@link ComponentProvider} which
 * is capable of managing scoped component registrations.
 *
 * <p>A scope can be provided to a {@link ComponentKey}, which can then be used
 * by a {@link ComponentProvider} to determine which components are available.
 * It is not ensured individual {@link ComponentProvider}s will support this,
 * except for {@link org.dockbox.hartshorn.application.context.ApplicationContext},
 * which will always support scopes.
 *
 * <p>Scopes can be used to determine which components are available in which
 * context. For example, this may be used to create short-lived singletons for
 * HTTP requests (e.g. for a {@code HttpRequest} and {@code HttpResponse}).
 *
 * <p>Scopes are expected to correctly implement {@link Object#equals(Object)} and
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} to ensure that they can be used as keys in a dictionary
 * of scopes.
