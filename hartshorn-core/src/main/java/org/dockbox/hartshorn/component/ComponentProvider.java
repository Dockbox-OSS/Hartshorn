/**
 * A component provider is a class that is capable of providing components. Components are identified using
 * {@link ComponentKey keys}. Components can be either managed or unmanaged. Managed components are typically
 * bound to an active {@link ApplicationContext} and are therefore available to all components in the application.
 * Unmanaged components are typically not explicitly registered, and may be treated as either injectable or
 * non-injectable, depending on the implementation.
 *
 * <p>Component providers are typically used to provide components to other components, and are therefore
 * typically injectable. However, they may also be used to provide components to non-injectable classes, such
 * as static classes. In this case, the provider will typically be obtained from a {@link ApplicationContext}
 * or another {@link ComponentProvider}.
 *
 * <p>Components may be provided from a configured scope, as defined in {@link ComponentKey#scope()}, or from
 * the default scope configured by the provider. The default scope is typically the same as the scope of the provider
 * itself, but this is not required.
