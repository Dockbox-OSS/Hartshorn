/**
 * A component pre-processor is responsible for pre-processing a component. This can be used to
 * validate the component before it is added to the application context, or to add additional
 * information to the component before it is created.
 *
 * <p>The component post processor will only process a component if it is known to the application, which
 * is validated through the active {@link ComponentLocator}. If no {@link ComponentContainer} exists for
 * the component, the component post processor will not be called.
 *
 * <p>To specify when a component post processor should be active, and when the application should ignore
 * it, the processor will always require an activator annotation to be specified as type parameter
 * {@code A}. If the specified annotation is not annotated with {@link ServiceActivator}, it is up to
 * the active {@link ApplicationContext} to decide whether this should be considered an error or not.
 *
 * <p>The component pre-processor will be called for each component that is added to the application.
 * It is executed during application construction.
