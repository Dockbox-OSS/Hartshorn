 * A simple functional interface that can be used to intercept method calls. The interceptor is called in series

 * replace the return value of the method call.

 * <p>A method interceptor is typically unaware of the exact method definition, and can therefore be used to intercept
 * any method call. However, it is not against convention to specifically target a particular method. Typically
 * however, the interceptor will be written to target a specific method signature, for example based on the presence
 * of a specific annotation.
