/**
 * An exception that is thrown when an attempt is made to use an invalid activator class

 * is a class that is not:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>abstract</li>
 *     <li>an interface</li>
 *     <li>an array</li>
 *     <li>a primitive</li>
 *     <li>a local class</li>
 *     <li>a member class</li>
 *     <li>in a reserved package</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that specific {@link ApplicationBuilder} implementations
 * may have additional requirements for valid activator classes.
