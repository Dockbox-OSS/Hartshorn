/**
 * Annotation to specify the property sources to load. This annotation can be used on any class that
 * is managed by the IoC container.
 *
 * <p>Property sources do not have to be files, but can be any kind of source that can be used to
 * load properties. Paths
 * can be absolute or relative, or an identifier that can be used to load the properties.
 *
 * <p>For example, the following paths are valid by default:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code classpath:application.properties}, through
 *         {@link org.dockbox.hartshorn.launchpad.resources.ClassPathResourceLookupStrategy}
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code fs:/etc/application.properties}, through
 *         {@link org.dockbox.hartshorn.launchpad.resources.FileSystemLookupStrategy}
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When multiple sources are specified, the order in which they are specified is the order in
 * which they are loaded.
