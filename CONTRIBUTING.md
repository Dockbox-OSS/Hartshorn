### Branches

- We follow a version-based branching model for development and releases, and a feature-based
  branching model for specific functionality.
- Feature branches should be named with the issue number and a brief description, like
  `feature/#123-sample-feature`.
- Access to development and release branches is limited to project maintainers.
- Bugfixes should use a `bugfix/` branch prefix.
- Chores should use a `chore/` branch prefix.
- New or enhanced functionality development should use a `feature/` branch prefix.

### Commits

- Always start commits with the related issue number, e.g., "#123".
- Provide a clear and concise message summarizing the purpose of the commit.
- Optionally, include a description for complex changes to enhance understanding.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests. To submit a PR, always follow
the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/Dockbox-OSS/Hartshorn/blob/develop/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

#### General notes

- Try to limit pull requests to a few commits which resolve a specific issue
- All proposed changes must be reviewed and approved by at least one organization member
- Describe the proposed changes with a relevant motivation and additional context
- Link to the original issue(s) which your changes relate to

## Testing Guidelines

- Use JUnit 5 for testing.
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) testing pattern.
- Place test classes in the `test.{package}` package. For example, `org.dockbox.hartshorn` becomes
  `test.org.dockbox.hartshorn`.
- Name test classes using the `{Class}Tests` convention. For example, `HartshornTests` for the
  `Hartshorn` class.

## Code Style

We maintain a consistent code style to ensure readability and maintainability. Our code style is
based on the [Square code style](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles), with a few minor
changes. Please follow the code style guidelines below when contributing to Hartshorn.

| Rule                                             | Motivation                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Indent with 4 spaces                             | Consistency with the existing codebase.          |
| Hard wrap at 140 columns                         | The default 100 column limit is too restrictive. |
| Place `else`, `catch`, etc. on new lines         | Improved readability and Git blaming             |
| Use braces around loops (`for`, `while`)         | Improved readability and Git blaming             |
| Always wrap enum constants                       | Improved readability and Git blaming             |
| Wrap annotations on classes, methods, and fields | Improved readability and Git blaming             |

## Code Inspections

We encourage the use of code inspections to maintain code quality. Please ensure the following
inspections are enabled:

| Inspection                                     | Enabled | Motivation                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warn about use of 'System.out' or 'System.err' | Yes     | Prevent accidental use of `System.out` and `System.err`. Encourage the use of logging instead.            |
| Warn when a type may be weakened               | Yes     | Encourage APIs to support as many implementations as possible.                                            | 
| AutoCloseable used without try-with-resources  | No      | `ApplicationContext` is `AutoCloseable` but should not be used with try-with-resources in most scenarios. |
| String literal may be equals qualifier         | Yes     | Prevents preventable NPEs by swapping x.equals("string") to "string".equals(x)                            |
| Missorted modifiers                            | Yes     | This is a common mistake, and should be avoided.                                                          |
| Unqualified method or field access             | Yes     | Being more explicit when calling methods or accessing fields is often clearer.                            |
| Unused return value                            | No      | Some methods may not be used internally, but are exposed for external use.                                |

## Documentation

We aim to provide comprehensive documentation for Hartshorn. Please ensure that your contributions
include relevant documentation updates. This includes updating Javadocs, Asciidoc documentation, and
other documentation files as necessary.

### Previewing documentation

When working with the Asciidoc documentation, you can build the documentation locally using Antora.

```shell
npm --prefix hartshorn-assembly/antora run antora -- playbook-local.yml
```

After building the documentation, you can view it in your browser by opening the [
`hartshorn-assembly/antora/target/site/index.html`](hartshorn-assembly/antora/target/site/index.html) file.

### Working with attachments

If your contribution includes attachments, please ensure that they are placed in the correct
location within the directory, following
the [standard file and directory set as defined by Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/standard-directories/).
Attachments should be referenced by their module name (e.g. `image::inject::diagram.svg[]`) and not
by relative paths (e.g. `image::../images/diagram.svg[]`).

SVG attachments should be inlined where possible, to retain as much information as possible.
See [Options for SVG images](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/image-svg/#options-for-svg-images)
for more information.

```asciidoc
image::sample.svg[Sample description,100,opts=inline] // OK, embedded
image::sample.svg[Sample description,100] // Not OK, image is rasterized
```

# Setting up new modules

Hartshorn is made up of multiple modules, each with its own responsibilities. Over time, the build
configuration for Hartshorn has grown to support our needs. However, this also comes with a cost:
setting up a new module can be a daunting task. This guide aims to simplify the process of setting
up a new module.

## Preparing the Maven module

### Setting up the project

As Hartshorn uses Maven, we need to set up a new Maven module. This is done by simply creating a
`pom.xml` file in the root of the module directory. You can also generate the project with
`mvn archetype:generate` if you have Maven installed locally.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <parent>
        <groupId>org.dockbox.hartshorn</groupId>
        <artifactId>hartshorn-platform-support</artifactId> <!-- Or alternatives, see below. -->
        <version>${revision}</version> <!-- Version is managed in the root POM. Individual modules should never deviate from this. -->
        <relativePath>../hartshorn-assembly/pom.platform.support.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>

    <name>Hartshorn TheModuleName</name>
    <description>A very awesome module solving a problem, or providing cool stuff somebody wants or needs</description>
    <artifactId>hartshorn-module-name</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
</project>
```

### Choosing the right parent module

Hartshorn modules are divided into several parent modules, each adding a different set of support
for the module. Below is a list of the available parent modules and their purpose. Each module
inherits from the previous one, so you can choose the one that fits your needs.

- `hartshorn-build-support`: The base parent module, providing the necessary setup to build the
  module.
- `hartshorn-staging`: A parent module, adding only the necessary setup to publish the module to the
  Maven Central repository.
- `hartshorn-platform-updates`: A parent module, adding tooling to update the module's dependencies
  to the latest versions.
- `hartshorn-platform-support`: A parent module, adding codestyle and documentation checks to the
  module.

In most cases, new modules should inherit from `hartshorn-platform-support`. Only inherit from other
parents if you have a specific need for them. For example, BOM modules may inherit from
`hartshorn-platform-updates`, as there should not be any code in these modules.

### Additional notes

#### Test fixtures

Test fixtures are a common part of Hartshorn modules. These are used to provide test templates for
unit tests. If your module requires test fixtures, you should create a `test-fixtures` module. This
module should be a separate Maven module, inheriting from the same parent as the main module. This
module should be named `hartshorn-module-name-test-fixtures`.

Test fixtures should have sources in the `main` sourceset, rather than the `test` sourceset. This is
because test fixtures are not tests themselves, but rather templates for tests. This also means you
should promote the required test dependencies to the `compile` scope, rather than the `test` scope.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-params</artifactId>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
    <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Registering the module

Once you have set up the Maven module, you need to register it with the Hartshorn build
configuration. This needs to be done in various places:

- The `modules` configuration in the root POM file. See [pom.xml](./pom.xml).
  ```xml
  <modules>
    <module>hartshorn-module-name</module>
  </modules>
  ```
- The `dependenyManagement` configuration in the BOM file.
  See [hartshorn-bom/pom.xml](./hartshorn-bom/pom.xml).
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.dockbox.hartshorn</groupId>
      <artifactId>hartshorn-module-name</artifactId>
      <version>${revision}</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
- The `dependencies` configuration in the assembly POM file. This does not require the version to be
  defined, as the assembly POM imports the Hartshorn BOM.
  See [hartshorn-assembly/pom.assembly.xml](./hartshorn-assembly/pom.assembly.xml).
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.dockbox.hartshorn</groupId>
        <artifactId>hartshorn-module-name</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
- The `start_paths` configuration in Antora playbooks.
  See [hartshorn-assembly/antora/playbook-local.yml](./hartshorn-assembly/antora/playbook-local.yml)
  and [hartshorn-assembly/antora/playbook-release.yml](./hartshorn-assembly/antora/playbook-release.yml).
  ```yaml
  start_paths:
    - hartshorn-module-name/src/main/docs
  ```
