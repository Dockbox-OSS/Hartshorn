/**
 * An annotation for components. Components are the building blocks of the framework. If a type is annotated with this
 * annotation, it is considered a component, allowing it to be processed using {@link
 * ComponentProcessor}s.
 *
 * <p>Components are identified by their type, but it is also possible to specify additional
 * standard properties. These properties are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #id()} - The unique identifier of the component. This is used to identify the component in the framework.
 *         If not specified, the type of the component is used to generate a valid ID through
 *         {@link ComponentUtilities#id(ComponentRegistry, Class)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #name()} - The name of the component. This is used to identify the component in the framework. If not
 *         specified, the name of the class is used.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #lifecycle()} - Indicates the lifecycle of the component. This is used to determine when the component
 *         should be created and destroyed. The default value is {@link LifecycleType#PROTOTYPE 'Prototype'}.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #type()} - The type of the component. This is used to indicate whether the component is a functional
 *         component, and thus modifiable, or if it should only be injected into.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following example shows how to annotate a class as a component:
 * <pre>{@code
 *      @Component
 *      public class MyComponent {
 *          // ...
 *      }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see Service
 * @see ComponentRegistry
 * @see ComponentContainer
 * @see ComponentProcessor
